## 📊 About Me

Hi! I'm Nolan, a Data Scientist with a passion for extracting meaningful insights from data. I specialize in transforming raw datasets into clear, actionable stories through analysis, visualization, and machine learning. With a strong foundation in statistical analysis, Python, SQL, and data visualization, I’m focused on solving real-world problems with data-driven solutions.

Currently, I am pursuing my Master's in Data Analytics at Northwest Missouri State UNiversity, expected to graduate in August, 2025.
